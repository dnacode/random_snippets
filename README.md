# random_snippets

A small collection of standalone scripts and code snippets for common tasks. This repository is a personal grab-bag of utilities, examples, and short automation scripts — intended for learning, reference, and occasional reuse.

## Contents

- delete-duplicate-files.ps1 — PowerShell script to find and optionally remove duplicate files (by hash) from a directory. Review and test before running; make backups.
- delete-yt-comments.js — Node.js script related to deleting YouTube comments (may require API keys or authentication). Use with caution and ensure compliance with YouTube's terms of service.

## Usage

Each file in this repository is a standalone snippet. To use a script:

1. Inspect the file to understand what it does.
2. Satisfy dependencies (PowerShell version, Node.js, required libraries, API credentials, etc.).
3. Test on sample data or in a safe environment before running on real files or accounts.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you have a snippet to add:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add your script in a clear, well-documented file.
3. Open a pull request describing the purpose and risks of the snippet.

Please avoid adding large binaries or secrets (API keys, tokens). All code should be safe to review.
